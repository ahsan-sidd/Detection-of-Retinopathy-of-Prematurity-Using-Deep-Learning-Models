# Automating ROP Diagnosis and Severity with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a condition affecting premature infants, which can lead to blindness if not detected and treated early. Due to the global shortage of trained specialists, particularly in resource-limited settings, timely diagnosis of ROP is challenging. This project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging deep learning to classify the severity of ROP from retinal images, enabling automated and scalable diagnosis.

This study compares the performance of five deep learning architectures: 
- Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- ResNet
- EfficientNet
- Inception
- VGG

The **Custom CNN** model outperformed others with a test accuracy of **98.48%**, making it the most reliable choice for automated ROP screening.

## Features
- **Classification of ROP Severity**: Automatic classification into 10 diagnostic classes using retinal fundus images.
- **Custom Deep Learning Model**: A CNN architecture specifically optimized for ROP detection.
- **Data Augmentation**: Addressing class imbalance through transformations to improve model generalization.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluation of popular architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, and Inception against the custom CNN.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, containing **6,004 retinal images** collected during ROP screenings at University Hospital Ostrava, Czech Republic. The images were annotated with:
- Diagnosis Codes (11 classes, reduced to 10 post-augmentation)
- Patient Metadata: Sex, Gestational Age, Birth Weight, Postconceptual Age, Imaging Device, and Series Number.

### Data Augmentation
To improve class balance and model robustness, the dataset was augmented using transformations:
- Small random rotations (up to 2Â°)
- Shifts (up to 5% of image dimensions)
- Scaling variations (0.85 to 1.15)
- Horizontal flips

Post-augmentation, the dataset grew to **12,342 images**, representing 10 diagnostic classes.
